# 💡Transistor LED Control Project
In this project, I implemented LED control by using a transistor (BC547). Purpose of this small project to learn and demonstrate how transistors work and where you can use it.

# ⚙️ Used Components
1. Push button - 1 
2. Resistor 220 Ohm - 1 
3. Resistor 10 kOhm - 2
4. Red LED 1
5. Transistor (BC547 B331) - 1
6. Jumper wires - 8
