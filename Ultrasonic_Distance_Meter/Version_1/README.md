# Description
Now I‚Äôm gonna explain how everything works. In this project, I used an ultrasonic sensor with a laser module glued to it, so you can see exactly where the ultrasonic waves hit an object. After that, I added a micro SD module to save the distance on the SD card. If the distance is saved successfully, the green LED lights up if not, the red LED turns on.
